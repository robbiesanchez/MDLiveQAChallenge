# MDLiveQAChallenge

For this coding challenge, I developed an API endpoint using Node.js and Express.js by connecting a json dataset of "apps" to the server. 

I accomplished this by setting up all the dependencies and scripts needed in my package.json, creating a json dataset of apps with ids and names, importing the data to my app.js and creating a get request for that data.
